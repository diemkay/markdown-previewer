## About Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language, originally created by John Gruber with help from Aaron Swartz, to allow people "to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)."

Made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
